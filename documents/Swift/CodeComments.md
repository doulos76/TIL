# Code comments

* Single line comment

```Swift
// This is a comment. It is not executed.
```


```Swift
// This is also a comment.
// Over multiple lines.
```

* Multi-line comment.

```Swift
/* This is also a comment.
	Over many...
	many...
	many lines. */
```

Swift also allows you to nest comments.

```Swift
/* This is a comment.

	/* And inside it
	is
	another comment.
	*/
	
	Back to the first.
*/
```
